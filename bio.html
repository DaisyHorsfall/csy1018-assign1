    <h1>A Bit About Me...</h1>

    <p>I enjoy a range of different activities. I love music
    and used to have weekly piano lessons, completing the
    exams up to Grade 5. Using the skills that I learned,
    I now continue to play the piano and have also started
    teaching myself to play the guitar.</p>

    <p>As well as this, I attend gym classes and go swimming
    regularly, and I also enjoy playing badminton and
    netball when I get the opportunity. On top of this, I
    like to spend time doing crafts, such as knitting,
    jewellery making, and sewing.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, I attend my church every Sunday and have
    made a lot of friendships through it. I help to teach
    the childrenâ€™s Sunday School lessons, and also take
    part in other Church activities such as study groups
    and charity events. I love being able to help others
    and also being able to study the Bible.

    <p class="bottom">I really love learning about technology, and I
    have now started a degree in Business Computing,
    specialising in Website Design and Development. I have
    already increased my computing knowledge in areas such
    as relational databases, HTML5, CSS, and problem
    solving. We will be going on to learn more about Java,
    JavaScript, SQL, and jQuery.</p>
