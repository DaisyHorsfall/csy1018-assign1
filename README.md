Daisy Horsfall - Assignment 1 - CSY1018

Hours taken to complete project: 20 hours.


Initial Commit - 21/11/16 This happened when I created the repository and cloned it to my local documents. The readme.md file was created too.

Version 1 - 21/11/16 In this version 4 HTML files have been added; 'index.html', 'cv.html', 'bio.html' and 'contact.html'. A css folder that contains the 'styles.css' file has also been added. I created the layout for the webpages, mainly working on the header and nav bar, and making sure all the links work.

Version 2 - 28/11/16 I have changed the look of the website in this version as I have incorporated the use of material design into it. This has influenced the colours and shadowing I have used. I have also added an image on the homepage.

Version 3 - 5/12/16 In this version I have completed the content on the Biography page, and added titles to each of the pages. As well as this, each HTML page has its own CSS document to link to. So the following four files have been added to the css folder; 'indexstyles.css', 'cvstyles.css', 'biostyles.css', and 'contactstyles.css'.

Version 4 - 5/12/16 I have completed the contact page. On the left side of the page is a contact form, and on the right is an image of a map and text with other ways to contact. The image has a 0.1em solid orange border with a border radius of 0.8em for the curved edge effect. It also has a shadow.

Version 5 - 5/01/17 Lots has been updated in this version. I have updated the footer on each page to include social media icons that link to their respective websites. A favicon has also been added for the site. I have changed the header on each page slightly - instead of having 'Daisy Horsfall' written out, a logo has been added. The orange has been replaced with a dusty blue-grey colour and the shadow effects have been changed. These are consistent throughout the whole site. I have added in a 1350x300 cover image (currently represented by a placeholder) and three boxes of information on the homepage (index page). Content on the 'CV' page has been added. I have shortened the biography on the 'Bio' page and have added 3 300x175 images (represented by placeholders). The styling on the 'Contact' page has also been updated to make the whole site consistent.

Version 6 - 6/01/17 I have added in a media query to adapt the website so it can be displayed well on mobile devices. It has a perimeter of 1 and 500px.

Version 7 - 6/01/17 I have added in a second media query so the website can be displayed well on a tablet device. It has a perimeter of 501 - 1024px.

Version 8 - 6/01/17 Added a bit more work on media queries.

Version 9 - 10/01/17 Made the website completely responsive, can be seen well on mobile devices, tablets and various sized computer screens.
