Daisy Horsfall - Assignment 1 - CSY1018


Initial Commit - 21/11/16
	This happened when I created the repository and cloned it to my local documents. The readme.md file was created
	too.


Version 1 - 21/11/16
	In this version 4 HTML files have been added; 'index.html', 'cv.html', 'bio.html' and 'contact.html'.
	A css folder that contains the 'styles.css' file has also been added. I created the layout for the webpages,
	mainly working on the header and nav bar, and making sure all the links work.

Version 2 - 28/11/16
	I have changed the look of the website in this version as I have incorporated the use of material design into it.
	This has influenced the colours and shadowing I have used. I have also added an image on the homepage.

Version 3 - 5/12/16
	In this version I have completed the content on the Biography page, and added titles to each of the pages. As well as this, each HTML page has its own CSS document to link to. So the following four files have been added to the css folder; 'indexstyles.css', 'cvstyles.css', 'biostyles.css', and 'contactstyles.css'.
